# MP3Scan utility in Python

This repo contains an MP3Scan utility in Python code.

This utility extracts information from an MP3 file, including:

* MPEG audio
* ID3 v1 tag
* ID3 v2 tag
* Embedded Lyrics
* Embedded Album Art

## Requirements

* You must have the following installed:
  * Python 3

* The code was written for:
  * Python 3

## Use a Virtual Environment

A Python environment is a self-contained directory that includes a specific version of Python and a set of installed packages. It is recommended using Python virtual environments for each project.

1. Create a virtual environment

  Open your terminal and run:

  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  ```

  This creates a folder named `.venv` containing the environment.

2. Activate the environment

 On Windows:

 ```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
 ```

 On macOS/Linux:

 ```bash
 source .venv/bin/activate
 ```

 Once activated, your terminal will show the environment name, like this:

 ```bash
 (.venv) $
 ```

3. Install packages inside the environment

 Now you can install packages without affecting your global Python setup:

 ```bash
 pip install mutagen
 ```

4. Deactivate the environment

 When you're done, simply run:

 ```bash
 deactivate
 ```

## Install library packages

Install the specified python packages.

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

On the other hand, you can install individual library packages on a per-project basis depending on your needs.

The list of individual library packages that the application uses:

* Audio Tags
  
  * `mutagen`

    Read and write audio tags for many formats.

    ```bash
    pip install mutagen
    ```

* Imaging Library
  
  * `pillow`

    Python Imaging Library (fork).

    ```bash
    pip install pillow
    ```

## Using the utility

* This utility reads information from MP3 files.
  
* Run the utility from the command line:

  ```bash
  python mp3scan.py <file_name>
  ```
  
* You will get the following information:

  * MPEG audio
  * ID3 v1 tag
  * ID3 v2 tag
  * Embedded Lyrics
  * Embedded Album Art

  View Audio Information (Technical):

  - Length: The total length of the song in seconds.
  - Bitrate: The data transmission rate of the audio, usually in kbps (kilobits per second). Mutagen can read Xing or LAME headers to accurately calculate the duration and bitrate in variable bitrate (VBR) MP3s.
  - Sample Rate: The number of audio samples taken per second, typically in Hz.
  - Bitrate Type: CBR or VBR
  - Channel Mode: Indicates whether the audio is Stereo, Mono, or Joint Stereo.
  - File Type: Confirmation that it is an MP3 file.

  View Metadata Information (ID3 Tags):

  - Title: The name of the song.
  - Artist: The artist or performer of the song.
  - Album: The name of the album the song belongs to.
  - Album Artist: The main artist on the album (useful for compilations).
  - Track Number: The song's position on the album.
  - Release Year: The year the song or album was released.
  - Genre: The musical style of the song.
  - Composer: The composer of the music.
  - Comments: Additional notes or comments.
  - Lyrics: The lyrics to the song.
  - Album Artwork (APIC or equivalent): The image embedded in the file.

## Running Tests

This project includes unit tests to verify the functionality of the script. The tests use the standard `unittest` library.

## Running Tests

This project includes unit tests to verify the functionality of the script.

### Using the standard library test runner

From the project root:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

### Optional: using pytest

If you prefer pytest, install it first in your virtual environment:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Execute the tests:

```bash
pytest -q
```
